# me (Ely Alvarado)

This is my personal README. There are a lot of readmes out there, and if you read them all, you might end up thinking that all engineering leaders are the same, that we all share the same values, and consider the same things important.

Well, I'm not going to lie, that might even be partially true. But at the same time we're all unique human beings with their own peculiarities, and things we like and we don't. And while I'll try to keep this README short, I'll also strive to make it personal, so that after reading it you have an specific idea of some quirks of working with me.

## What I like doing

* Helping to create teams that value and practice continuous learning, and continuous improvement.
* Collaborating with people on solving hard problems (and the previous bullet is one of such problems).

## What I don't like to do

* Chores and repetitive tasks completely drain my energy.

## What I value

Have you seen one of those list of personal values?, like [James Clear's Core Value List](https://jamesclear.com/core-values), or [Brenee Brown's List of Values](https://daretolead.brenebrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Values.pdf). Well if you have, you'll know that upon reading such a list there are going to be words that resonate with you, as well as some that don't. If you had to choose only 5 from such a list, which ones would you choose? Well these are mine:

* Parenting
* Integrity
* Learning
* Accountability
* Resourcefulness

While there are many other values that I care about, these are the ones that I'll probably choose given any conflict between other values.

## My Strengths
There are many online questionnaires that can help you understand your strengths. In my case I took the [University of Toronto Strengths Based Resiliency SSQ-72](https://strengthsbasedresilience.com/)

And this are my [results](https://strengthsbasedresilience.com/assessments/feedback/BQMlgWq9L7):

**Signature Strength Questionnaire (SSQ-72)**


* **Appreciation of Beauty & Excellence**: You are very good at perceiving and appreciating beauty and excellence in many areas of life, from nature to art to mathematics to science. Display of excellence inspires you. You love to incorporate things of beauty in your surroundings. You feel at ease when you are amid art or watching a great performance.
* **Fairness, Equity & Justice**: You treat everyone fairly. You stand up for others when they are bullied or ridiculed. You care genuinely about the welfare of others, even those you do not know personally. You do not make excuses to justify your mistakes and you do not let your personal feelings influence your decisions about other people. You give everyone a fair chance. With those who make the right decisions, you follow them as a role model.
* **Forgiveness & Mercy**: You never hold grudges and good at letting go of wrong-doing of others. You forgive easily those who have offended or hurt you and once you forgive, you stay committed to it and rarely bring up the hurt again - because you don't not believe in revenge and always give others a second chance.
* **Hope, Optimism & Future-mindedness**: Despite challenges and setbacks, you always remain hopeful that things will work out eventually. You feel and believe that if you use all your resources and work hard, you will achieve your goals. Therefore, a setback or a challenge does not dampen your spirits easily - because it doesn't affect each and every aspect of your life. For you, a low grade on an exam is a setback but it doesn't ruin your whole academic performance. This realistic perceptive allows you to see the best, yet most realistic, aspects of the situation. You plan for the future with good cheer and with sustained effort.
* **Love of Learning**: You love to learn new things -- in school or on your own. You make very good use of opportunities where you can gain knowledge about skills, concepts, ideas, and facts. You have always enjoyed school and reading. When it comes to learning, you are persistent; even if you get frustrated or distracted, you refocus and don't give up until you have mastered the topic or skill.

### What I value on a team

It's ok to know my personal values, but how does that translate to what I value on a team, or at work? Well 

* **Short feedback loops and continous learning**: There is no better way to _**learn**_, and to do it all the time than to have short feedback loops. Feedback provides all that you need to correct course, or to stay put and validate what you just learned. The fastest you get that feedback, the fastest you learn something.
* **Trust**: This is the base of the piramid for building effective teams. I doubt there is goingn to be a manager README out there that doesn't mention this one. But how do you get there? I believe that acting with _**integrity**_ and holding yourself and others _**accountable**_ is one of the best ways to build trust.
* **Shipping**: No matter the difficulties, you need to ship (_**resourcefulness**_). If you act with _**integrity**_, use those short feedback loops to continuously _**learn**_, hold yourself and other **accountable** on the results, then you'll not only ship, but you'll ship the right thing.

## How do I like to communicate

### Manifesto for Having Effective Conversations with Me

_I know what works better for me, but I can also adapt to the way others prefer to communicate, and I'm continously striving to learn how to communicate better and through as many channels as possible. Through my work I've come to value:_

* _Sync over async communication_
* _Talking over written communication_
* _In person over zoom or phone_
* _And chat over email_

_That is, while I value conversations done with the channels in the right, I value the channels on the left more_

_**Did you catch that [reference](http://agilemanifesto.org/)?**_

Yes, I know, scaling remote organizations requires Asynchronous communication, and I'm continuosly trying to learn ways in which I can learn to do it better, and in which it can be improved. However, I'm also a firm believer of **short feedback loops**, and it is undeniable that (when done well) the things on the left have shorter feedback loops than the things on the right.
